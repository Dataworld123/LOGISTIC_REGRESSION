    "Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Linear regression is used for predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables. It establishes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.\n",
    "Output: The output is a continuous value. For example, predicting house prices, temperature, or sales revenue.\n",
    "Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Logistic regression is used for predicting the probability of an event occurring, which is binary in nature (0 or 1). It's commonly employed for classification problems where the outcome is categorical.\n",
    "Output: The output is a probability value between 0 and 1, which is then transformed into a binary outcome. For instance, predicting whether an email is spam or not (1 or 0), or predicting whether a student passes or fails.\n",
    "Example Scenario:\n",
    "Let's consider a scenario of predicting whether a student passes or fails an exam based on the number of hours they studied. This is a binary outcome (pass or fail), making it suitable for logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a dataset with two variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent Variable (X): Number of hours a student studied.\n",
    "Dependent Variable (Y): Binary outcome - Pass (1) or Fail (0).\n",
    "In this case, logistic regression would be appropriate because it models the probability of passing the exam given the number of hours studied. The output would be a probability between 0 and 1, and you can set a threshold (e.g., 0.5) to classify the student as either passing or failing based on the predicted probability.\n",

    "Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting, a common problem where a model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. In logistic regression, overfitting may occur when the model becomes too complex, fitting the training data too closely, and capturing noise in the data rather than the underlying pattern. Regularization helps mitigate this issue by adding a penalty term to the cost function, discouraging the model from assigning excessive importance to any particular feature.\n",

    "L2 Regularization (Ridge): In L2 regularization, the penalty term is proportional to the square of the weights. It tends to keep all features, but it reduces the impact of each feature, preventing the model from relying too heavily on a small set of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "By introducing these regularization terms, logistic regression becomes less sensitive to the noise in the training data, and the model is encouraged to find a balance between fitting the data well and keeping the weights small. This, in turn, helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's generalization to new, unseen data. The choice between L1 and L2 regularization depends on the specific characteristics of the problem and the desired properties of the model.\n",
